Description: This is a companion to Henry-Stewart talk by Zhao (2026, <doi:10.69645/FRFQ9519>),
 which gathers information, metadata and scripts to showcase modern genetic analysis -- ranging from testing
 of polymorphic variant(s) for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, association with traits using genetic and statistical
 models, Bayesian implementation, power calculation in study design, and genetic annotation. It also covers
 R integration with the Linux environment, GitHub, package creation and web applications. The earlier version
 by Zhao (2009, <doi:10.69645/DCRY5578>) provides a brief introduction to these topics.
