Description: It gathers information, meta-data and scripts in a two-part Henry-Stewart talk by
 Zhao (2009, <doi:10.69645/DCRY5578>), which showcases analysis in aspects such as testing of polymorphic
 variant(s) for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, association with trait using genetic and statistical models
 as well as Bayesian implementation, power calculation in study design and genetic annotation. It also
 covers R integration with the Linux environment, GitHub, package creation and web applications.
