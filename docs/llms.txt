## Genetic Association Analysis

This is a companion to Henry-Stewart talk by Zhao (2026,
\<[doi:10.69645/FRFQ9519](https://doi.org/doi:10.69645/FRFQ9519)\>),
which gathers information, metadata and scripts to showcase modern
genetic analysis – ranging from testing of polymorphic variant(s) for
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, association with traits using genetic and
statistical models, Bayesian implementation, power calculation in study
design, and genetic annotation. It also covers R integration with the
Linux environment, GitHub, package creation and web applications. The
earlier version by Zhao (2009,
\<[doi:10.69645/DCRY5578](https://doi.org/doi:10.69645/DCRY5578)\>)
provides an brief introduction to these topics.
